# DiscoverElPaso

This is the culmination of 10 weeks worth of work during my software development internship at Coding it Forward, where I worked on a project for the City of El Paso along with two other interns, Parita Shah (Development) and Alyson Lam (UX design)

## Functionality

We built a mobile app that allows citizens and tourists to the city to experience the history of the [Chalk the Block Festival](https://www.chalktheblock.com/) in Augmented Reality. Combining GIS data with AR, we were able to create an interactive walking tour, taking the user on a journey through the festival's history, experiencing art works from years past.

## Tooling

We also wanted to build a project that would last and could easily be converted towards other use cases. With that in mind, we created an app that works with proven design tool Figma. On the back end, location data sets are easily swappable offering no-code and low-code solutions for future developers.

The project was developed in Unity 2021.3.3f1

## Further information

More information on the project can be found at [this PowerPoint](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TTGM1U8mnO3mkOMJcp6RdbOMpcgrZ5y3U31hP9eSVd8/edit?usp=sharing).

For a demo, see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbuPfNKIC28&ab_channel=UXTeam).

We look forward to the app launching in the App Store and Google Play Store as we near October in anticipation of the Chalk the Block festival.

Please feel free to clone the project and play around with it on your own!
